        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup curry powder, or to taste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion and saut√© until soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add chicken; reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Uncover and cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until pan juices reduce to desired amount, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
